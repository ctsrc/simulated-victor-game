<p><strong>The Victor Game</strong> – a name I use in reference to this guy
  <a href=https://github.com/victorqribeiro>Victor Ribeiro</a> that created
  <a href=https://victorribeiro.com/googolGame/>the game we are talking about here</a> –
  is a game that has characteristics similar to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem>The Secretary Problem</a>,
  but where the numbers are generated in a specific, known way. With this knowledge, it is possible to make
  better decisions in the game than one would do if one were applying the Optimal Stopping Rule (OSR)
  from The Secretary Problem when playing The Victor Game.
<p>User GistNoesis on Hacker News <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21701124#21732695>explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The distribution chosen here is ~ uniform for the number of digits.
    [<a href=https://github.com/victorqribeiro/googol/blob/7cb61ff1374c6d18bea61ecf8ba89c01d0f1d000/js/main.js#L10>github.com/victorqribeiro/googol/blob/7cb61ff/js/main.js#L10</a>]
  <p>This is not the same hypothesis as the problem stated in the video
    [<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeJobV4jJG0>youtu.be/OeJobV4jJG0</a>].
    The video talks about the "secretary problem". In [the secretary problem] you know nothing about the distribution.
    You just know that the number are ordered.
  <p>Here because you know the distribution you can do better by using a strategy which choose to stop
    depending on the value of the number you have so far. For example if at the 15th pick you get a number with 99 digit,
    you can safely assume that it is better to stop now (every time you pick you have only a ~1% chance of finding a 99-digit
    number needed to do better so keeping it means you win (99/100)^(50-16) = 70%, whereas the non-exploitable strategy
    (i.e. optimal strategy for the secretary problem) 50/e=18 will tell you to keep going and you would lose 70% of the times).
  <p>For the secretary problem the theoretical way to sample the number is to set it up as a game where the first player
    plays the game and the second pick the numbers adversely so that the first doesn't win. A good strategy for the second
    player is to pick a distribution from a big set of varied distributions, and sample the number from this distribution.

<h2>Simulation</h2>
<noscript><p>Note: JavaScript must be enabled in order to run simulation.</p></noscript>
<p>Below we simulate 1000 rounds of The Victor Game, and we pit the original optimal stopping rule up against the
  algorithm described by GistNoesis for the specific way that numbers are being generated in The Victor Game.
  Additionally, we run a simple random choice for comparison which has a 50% probability of saying stop
  each time it is asked whether to stop or to continue.
<p>Results from the simulation are summarized in <a href=#results-summary>a separate table</a> for easy review.
<p id=note-about-summary>Please note that the percentages shown in the summary table reflect the percentage of rounds
  in which the "correct" choice was made for each of the three algorithms. The algorithms are given the same inputs
  for each round, but each of them do not "know" what the other algorithms are choosing and are not affected by
  whether or not the other algorithms choose the biggest number or not. In any round, they could all make
  the "correct" choice, or two of them could, or one of the could, or none of the could. Point is, it's usually
  not a case of one winner and two losers for each individual round.
